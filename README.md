# Learn-to-Web
Starting from nothing, going to learn how to do web development.


I know nothing about web development.

But I'm going to learn.

The goal is to raise my old favorite browser game from the grave.

To do that I am going to need to learn how to do a backend that can handle users, multiplayer rooms, and rankings.

That will need a frontend. That will need to be designed. It takes money to host stuff so I will need to put in ads. It should also be somewhat scaleable as well.

This will all need security. I am probably missing even more fundamental stuff, but thats the point, I don't even know what I don't know.


Here is what I do know about web development: 
-PHP is bad
-A few acronyms
-Some networking theory
-Some distributed system theory
-a bit of django(just a bit)
-a tiny bit of SQLite from Android
-API's are a thing

Lets hit it.
